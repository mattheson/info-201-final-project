# INFO 201 Final Project, Group 36, Public Health

## Why are we interested in public health?
Public health has become a topic of focus in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are interested in understanding international conditions of public health beyond what
we've already learned these past two years from the pandemic.

We are interested in focusing on mortality in different age groups/nationalities, looking at
reasons and rates of death.

## Data-Driven Questions
1. What are the most common causes of death in different _age groups_?
2. How do these causes of death between different age groups compare _between countries_?
3. How much does _access to healthcare_ affect mortality rates (inside and between countries)?

## Examples of Data-Driven Projects
1. [Morbidity and Mortality among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/center-for-adolescent-health/_images/_pre-redesign/az/US%20Fact%20Sheet_FINAL.pdf)
2. [Leading Causes of Death in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/mortality-leading-causes/index.htm)
3. [An International Comparison of Adolescent and Young Adult Mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3938202/)

# Datasets
  1. [Child mortality data](https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/child-mortality/)
    - How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
    - 600 rows, 33 columns
    - We can compare the mortality rates of young people between countries to make conclusions about the risk they are at because of their location. Another question we can answer is what country has the lowest mortality rate for young people (i.e. in what country do young people survive the most?)?
