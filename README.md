# INFO 201 Final Project, Group 36, Public Health

## Why are we interested in public health?
Public health has become a topic of focus in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are interested in understanding international conditions of public health beyond what
we've already learned these past two years from the pandemic.

We are interested in focusing on mortality in different age groups/nationalities, looking at
reasons and rates of death.

## Data-Driven Questions
1. What are the most common causes of death in different _age groups_?
2. How do these causes of death between different age groups compare _between countries_?
3. How much does _access to healthcare_ affect mortality rates (inside and between countries)?

## Examples of Data-Driven Projects
