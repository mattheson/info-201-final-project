# INFO 201 Final Project, Group 36, Public Health

## Why are we interested in public health?
Public health has become a topic of focus in recent years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
We are interested in understanding international conditions of public health beyond what
we've already learned these past two years from the pandemic.
We are interested in focusing on life expectancy and mortality between different age groups/countries.

## Data-Driven Questions
1. What are the most common causes of death in different _age groups_?
2. How do these causes of death between different age groups compare _between countries_?
3. How does life expectancy differ between countries and what factors might be affecting it?
4. How much does _access to healthcare_ affect mortality rates/life expectancy (inside and between countries)?

## Examples of Data-Driven Projects
1. [Morbidity and Mortality among Adolescents and Young Adults in the United States](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/center-for-adolescent-health/_images/_pre-redesign/az/US%20Fact%20Sheet_FINAL.pdf)
2. [Leading Causes of Death in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/mortality-leading-causes/index.htm)
3. [An International Comparison of Adolescent and Young Adult Mortality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3938202/)

# Datasets
  - 1. [Child Mortality](https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/child-mortality/)
    - UNICEF Data collected the data for the purpose of presenting country-specific data for mortality rates of people ages 20-24. “The team generates data-driven thought products, ranging from short brochures to in-depth analyses like major reports.” (UNICEF Data & Analytics)
    - 600 rows, 33 columns
    - We can compare the mortality rates of young people between countries to make conclusions about the risk they are at because of their location. Another question we can answer is what country has the lowest mortality rate for young people (i.e. in what country do young people survive the most?)?
  - 2. [Life Expectancy](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)
    - The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The data-sets are made available to the public for the purpose of health data analysis. The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data was collected from the United Nations website.
    - 2938 rows, 22 columns
    - How has life expectancy changed over time? What other factors influence life expectancy that are not explicitly health related (i.e. economic factors)? What countries have the highest life expectancy and are there countries that we might be surprised by?
  - 3. [Leading Causes of Death in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data-visualization/mortality-leading-causes/index.htm)
    - This data was collected by the CDC using death certificates filed throughout the United States.
    - 10868 rows, 6 columns
    - What is the leading cause of death in the USA over the last 18 years? Which states have the highest death rates of specific causes?
