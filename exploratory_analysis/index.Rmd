## Life Expectancy over Time

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Chart 1
ggplot(year, aes(x=Group.1,y=Life.expectancy)) +
  geom_bar(stat="Identity", fill="steelblue") + 
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Life Expectancy") +
  facet_zoom(ylim = c(60, 75))
```

We included this chart to show how life expectancy has changed over the years.
We think that it's important to see the general trend and see if it
aligns of what we think how life expectancy should change, and We think that
it does corroborate with our beliefs that as time passes on our health as
technology gets better.
